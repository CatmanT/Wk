1.1 Update for 21 Builds
--- Chameleon 21 and DaBs Shield Build 21 LITE ---

- Fixed AutoCompletion Keyboard script
- Fixed Trakt Script
- Fixed "Because you Watched for.." for DSB-Lite
- Added LostSouls Repo, (New repo for Asgard, Shazam)


---Added 2 Builds for Kodi 21---
- Chameleon 21 is a close port of chameleon 19 to Kodi 21. There are some more things I will need to do to get it as close to the previous ver as I can get. This build should get users on Kodi 21 up and going.

- Dabs Shield Build 21 is a port of DSB to Kodi 21. I did remove the LIVE TV widget but you can add it back on your own if you choose to. Just install SIMPLE CLIENT from kodi repo under PVR clients. Then go to The Loop or Mad Titan and look in tools for PVR installer. 

-- If you are on Kodi 20 there is no need to update, this is just giving Kodi 21 users options. --
